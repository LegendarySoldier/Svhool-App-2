        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Can education be less about memorising, and more about making a memory? Can a lesson be touched, tasted, smelt and seen, instead of just read? Can we mould empowered human beings, instead of just skilled students?

            At Ekya, we can.

            Ekya is a community of learners, thinkers, doers and changemakers. Ekya stands for a sense of togetherness, collaboration and unity – Ekya is a community where everyone forges ahead with purpose. The word Ekya is derived from the Sanskrit sounds of unity and individuality. It embodies the spirit of collaboration and togetherness while allowing space for the individual to grow. The Ekya logo can be interpreted in many ways and we love seeing students derive their own meaning from it.

            Drawing on the legacy of the CMR Group of Institutions and the innovative, immersive methods of school systems around the world, our schools were instituted with one aim – to teach children not just what to learn, but how to learn. Here, knowing how to learn is a skill in itself, and the key to creating lifelong learners with the means to adapt and thrive in a constantly changing world.

            So, welcome to Ekya, the place where we live the lesson. Every single day.</p>
